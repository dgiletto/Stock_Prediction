## Stock Prediction App
This React web app allows users to forecast stock prices and evaluate the accuracy of a predictive model (e.g., LSTM). It provides:
- Historical vs. Predicted Closing Price Graph
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) Evaluation
- 7 Day Forecast Visualization with Confidence Interval Bands
- Investment Suggestions (Buy / Sell / Hold)
- Sidebar with Live Stock Details

### Preview
